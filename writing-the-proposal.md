# Study Outline

# Role of the Supervisor
## Contact Hours
Contact hours refer to the duration of time to which the supervisor and student are expected to meet face-to-face to discuss the progress of the Study.

The recommended *minimum* is at least a weekly face-to-face meeting to update your supervisor on your progress and issues faced so that they can be quickly rectified.

## Mode of Assessment
The mode of assessment is for the student to determine how each component of their project is weighted for their supervisor to grade them.

##### Example

| Component         | Weightage |
|-------------------|-------|
| Consultation | 15% |
| Mid-semester Report | 15% |
| Oral Presentation | 30% |
| Final Report | 40% |
